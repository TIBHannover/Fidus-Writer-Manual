Before starting it is important to note that the site owners can setup user account additions to work in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Where users can register on the site,


\item Alternatively, where uses cannot register and instead must be invited to the site.


\end{enumerate}

There are different ways to add users to Fidus Writer:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bulk addition as a Super user from /admin/auth/user/add/. Here a user can be added with: username, password, email, name, given a user role, etc.


\item
