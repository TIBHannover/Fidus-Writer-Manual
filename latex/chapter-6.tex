Access controlled by association to a document template and the templates owner and owner contacts. A document template only has one owner. A document style can be associated to many document templates. If a document template has no owner then all users can access all associated document styles. Document templates can be duplicated by users who have access and edited themselves, these duplicated document templates get copies of the assocated document styles.

\subsubsection{Adding users}\label{H9537775}



Before starting it is important to note that the site owners can setup user account additions to work in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Where users can register on the site,


\item Alternatively, where uses cannot register and instead must be invited to the site.


\end{enumerate}

There are different ways to add users to Fidus Writer:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bulk addition as a Super user from /admin/auth/user/add/. Here a user can be added with: username, password, email, name, given a user role, etc.
